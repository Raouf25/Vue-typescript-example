### Styling

- SASS/SCSS pre-processor is used for CSS styling.
- Element UI library is used to enhance the look and feel of the app.
- Basic responsive design
- CSS Resets

### Vuex

Vuex is used to store common data and accessed using helpers in components. It also follows a modular approach by creating specific modules to store and access data.

### Typing

This application follows a class-based API approach. The `vue-property-decorator` is used to decorate modules in component files. The `vuex-module-decorators` is used to decorate Vuex modules, and the `vuex-class` library is used to access Vuex properties such as `state`, `actions`, `getters` etc. in components.
